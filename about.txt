Hi Team,

I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and share a bit about who I am outside of work. My name is Abraham Bisrat, and I’m excited to join the team as a senior software engineer. I’m the second child in my family, with two wonderful sisters who have always been a big part of my life.

I originally come from a small town in Ethiopia, and I currently live in North Dallas, a place I’ve grown to love for its vibrant community and great opportunities for outdoor activities. In my free time, I have a few hobbies that keep me busy and balanced. I’m an avid chess player and enjoy the strategic challenges the game presents. I also love creating pencil drawings, which allows me to express my creativity in a different way.

Staying active is important to me, so I spend a good amount of time at the gym, swimming, and occasionally fishing. These activities not only help me stay fit but also provide a great way to unwind and connect with nature.

Professionally, I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering, which laid a solid foundation for my career in software development. Over the past six years, I’ve had the opportunity to work for several companies, where I’ve honed my skills in full-stack development. My experience ranges from designing and implementing web applications to optimizing performance and ensuring scalability. I am proficient in technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, and Node.js, and I have a strong background in working with cloud platforms like AWS.

I firmly believe that the best results come from collaborative efforts. Teamwork is at the heart of my work philosophy, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to and learn from this talented team. I look forward to bringing my skills and experience to the table, fostering a collaborative environment, and driving our projects to success.

I look forward to getting to know all of you better and contributing to our collective success. Please feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat more about any of these interests or just to say hello!

Best regards,
Abraham Bisrat
